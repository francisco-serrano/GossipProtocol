The application given is organized in three layers:
 - Emulated Network: EmulNet
 - Application
 - P2P Layer
 
 The functionality of the P2P Layer was initially limited. In this layer, the membership protocol had to be implemented. 

# Testing
In order to test and submit the implementation, a grader was needed. The required commands to do are the following:
```
  $ chmod +x Grader_fixed.sh
  $ ./Grader_fixed
```
